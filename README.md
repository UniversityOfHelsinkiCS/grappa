# Grappa

This repository is the "current" version of the application, replacing both https://github.com/UniversityOfHelsinkiCS/back-grappa2 and https://github.com/UniversityOfHelsinkiCS/front-grappa.

Automatic deployment from "main" branch to staging. 

Tagging / creating a release will release the version to production.

# Development

TODO. You can probably get it running by following the backend instructions and running `docker-compose up --build` in the root.
